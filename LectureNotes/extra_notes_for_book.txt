SPLASH-E

bridge of HCI-meets-non-HCI sections 

- Feedback from Molly's Students:
-- Runestone Academy (CS1/CS2) online textbooks
   -- Integrating code into e-textbook, interactive stuff
-- Students are very 20. Very age-sensitive, recent matters.
---- Make sure to keep recent papers in there.

Depth vs. breadth tradeoffs:
- In first chapter:~
--- Course outlines
Parallelism + Process Calculus => Grabbaggy, don't fit class structure as clearly.


Learning goals:
- How to explain the meaning and purpose of types to someone who's not going to use the types?

- Bilingualism
- Implementation
- Math

- Document the process of learning

- Steve Czechowiech - Systems in Rust

--- Python 2 -> 3 took 15 years

- How to Pick a Programming Language
- (Why do you hate Racket)?

- Lambda Calculus?

- History of programming languages and contingent truth

Extra notes

Chapter 2:
Because there is no direct notation for reference values, we will typically denote reference values by drawing boxes around the values they contain or by writing addresses in braces {123,456,789} to indicate that they are distinct from integer literals.
