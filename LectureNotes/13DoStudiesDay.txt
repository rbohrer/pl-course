"Lecture" 13: Do Studies Today.

Today is dedicated to carrying out your user studies for your
programming languages, using your classmates. This will be done during
classtime. If the number of teams is small enough, we will do all the
studies in class, at the same time.

For example, if there are 4 teams, then we will set up 4 "stations" in
the four corners, one for each team.  Each team should pick their
experimenter(s) and let me know in advance. Then, I will send out a
schedule that looks like this:


Experimenter A: <name>
Experimenter B: <name>
Experimenter C: <name>
Experimenter D: <name>
and divide the remaining students in batch of 4 (or however many teams).

Each batch is assigned an equal amount of time. For example, 20 students
in 5 batches evenly dividing 80 minutes would get 16 minutes per batch

Batch 1 (4:00-4:16):
Student 1, Student 2, Student 3, Student 4

Batch 2 (4:16-4:32):
Student 5, Student 6, Student 7, Student 8

Batch 3 (4:32-4:48):
Student 9, Student 10, Student 11, Student 12

Batch 4 (4:48-5:04):
Student 13, Student 14

Batch 5 (5:04-5:20): 
<the experimenters>

The goal is for each student to do each exercise once, then the batch
rotates.  That is, aim for a 4-minute experiment, so each 4-person
batch finishes in 16 minutes.

The experimenters are welcome to switch out with their teammates at
any time - in fact, it's best if you all get to do the experiment, so
it's good to switch out at least once by the end.

If you are not an experimenter, you can just come for your assigned
batch time and then leave. That's the goal of splitting everything
into batches - this way, nobody has to sit idle all period. If this
feels overdesigned or you're worried about arriving at the wrong time,
don't worry, we can adjust if needed. The goal is just to make optimal
use of *your* time :)

I will mostly sit out of the way and let you do your thing, but I will
be present if you need help with anything.
