"Lecture" 14: Reflection + Planning.

Today's a hands-on day. The goals are to

1: Give me feedback how the course is going so far
2: Reflect on what you've done so far
3: Plan what you want each of us to do in the second half.


1: Course Feedback

This section is you giving me feedback on what I've done with the
first half of the course and what you'd like me to do in the next
half.

I'll write some prompts on the board and give you time to respond to
them on the board, and to chat amongst yourselves as you do so. I can
go hide for a minute if you're feeling a bit shy to give criticism in
front of me.

Prompt Set 1: 3 columns:  "Stop Doing"   "Start Doing"   "Keep Doing"
Write words/phrases under each column, telling me what I should stop/start/keep doing as a teacher.


Prompt Set 2:

Issue/Solution In two columns, identify any issues on your mind
regarding the course and/or any solution ideas for issues you/your
classmates have raised.

For both sets, write +1 on remarks that you agree with or want to give
extra attention to.

I'll save *all* of these so I get your full input, then we'll spend
some group time discussing any especially popular points.

2: Reflect
Read over your mid-semester eval forms in your groups again if needed.
Synthesize your previous meeting discussion intoA

1) One thing you're proud of
2) One thing to focus on next term

Share #2 with your teammates and instructor (privately if needed),
and share #1 publicly with the class at the end.

3: Plan

I will hang around and be available for advice. As a team, write a
letter to "yourself a week from now" about what you want to do next
term, what you've been doing, what your plans are, so that you can go
take a break and not forget everything when you come back into work
mode.
