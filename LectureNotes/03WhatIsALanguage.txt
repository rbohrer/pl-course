Exercise: Write the names of some PLs on the board.
Then discuss: for each of your projects, which of these languages
do you consider using, why, and what weaknesses come with that choice?

** Everything is a programming language (PL)?

There's a reason that lots of people take PL classes: the ideas from
PL classes come up in a lot of different places.

Where could these ideas come up? They certainly come up if you write
compilers for a living or if you do graduate-level research about PL
theory for a living. I love those things, but a small number of people
do this. So why the attention?

Answer: Because "PL thinking" shows up everywhere. We'll define that soon. Here are some examples first.

- Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are programming languages optimized
for a certain application domain.
-- Shader languages like GLSL are designed for writing graphical
   shaders, used in video games and other digital media
-- Permission policy languages are used to let users define complex
   policies for managing their own security and privacy
-- Macro languages (e.g. AutoHotKey) are used by end-users to improve
   productivity in diverse end-user computing tasks.
   
- Little languages and pseudo-languages: respectively, these are (1)
  structured languages that lack much computing power and (2) programs
  that, despite not looking like languages at all, have all the same
  interesting structure that a language does.

Little language examples:
- Config files
- Log files
- Plain-text file formats for data

Pseudo-language examples:
- Spreadsheets
- Email filters
- Effects and filters in image/video/sound-editing programs

Once you look at PL this way, you can see why PL is for everyone. Even
if you never wrote a line of code in your life, you're still likely to
engage with pseudo-languages. Everyone from office workers to
creatives use these, not just compiler engineers. And most programmers
will write code that deals with little languages or pseudo-languages
at some point in their career.

** Schools of Thought

In this course, I often discuss how there are many "schools of
thought" about PLs. What this means is that different communities of
people think about programming languages in radically different
ways. This course is not here to tell you which school of thought you
should belong to. It's here to provide you breath, and see which
thoughts exist.

Examples:
- "The Type Theory School"

This school says that PLs are formal languages that can be defined and
analyzed mathematically. A "good PL" is a language that we can analyze
in powerful ways. Typically, a "good PL" has a rich static type system
that lets us prove a soundness theorem, which is something like:

Theorem[Soundness]:
"Any time your compiler accepts a program from you without giving an
error message, that program will satisfy
<some specific notion of correctness, chosen by the designers>"

Example correctness notions are freedom from segmentation faults,
freedom from data races and deadlocks, producing an output of the
intended type, or freedom from memory leaks.

I was trained in this school. Many of us joined this school because it
appeals to our personal sense of mathematical beauty. That does not
make it better nor worse than other schools!

- "The Software Engineering School"
This school says that researchers should study how professional
programmers use programming languages. We should design languages and
language tools based on how professional programmers are likely to use
them. At the same time, we should use this knowledge to propose how
programmers should work together and how their managers should do the
job of management. Both the language and person can change.

- "The Social Science School"
This school overlaps highly with both Software Engineering and
Critical Studies - these are not binary categories. This school
emphasizes that researchers should study humans. Software Engineers
will use social science to make better languages, tools, or management
strategies. But social sciences could also study humans for humans'
sakes. They often study social issues within communities of
programmers and computer users. Who do these communities include or
exclude? Why? What could be done about that? These questions are
answered using scientific approaches, which are often but not always
quantitative.

- "The Critical Studies School"
This school also studies social issues. It asks who communities
include or exclude? Why? What could be done about that? The difference
is that it uses methods from the humanities. Important books about
computing could be read closely and their language analyzed. People
look at rhetoric about languages and rhetorical structure present in
code itself. People do theory-building, taking core ideas from social
theorists and applying them to the specifics of PL communities.
This school is relatively small, but exciting. 

- "The Lay Practitioner School"
This is the biggest school: people who code. The Type Theory school
often mocks this group and the Software Engineering school might
sometimes patronize it. This is not okay. Most of our students go on
to this school.

It's important to know that these different groups *exist* though,
because it allows you to recognize that each of these groups uses
different vocabulary to talk about programming languages, uses them in
different ways, and has different conversations. When I use vocab from
the Type Theory school, it is common for students to struggle with
communication because they're only familiar with how those words are
used in the Lay Practitioner school. My goal is not to convert you,
but my goal *is* to make you bilingual or even a polyglot. In
particular, a Lay Practitioner can learn a lot from the Type Theory
school because it will help you make thoughtful choices about which
tools you want to use in your career, when, and how.

EXERCISE: Which schools of thought are most likely to influence your
project, and how? Any school of thought that you’re specifically not
interested in?

Tourism:
PL courses are often organized as tours. Many courses take a tour of
different kinds of programming languages; others take an extended tour
of the Type Theory school. In this course, the first half is a tour of
skills for performing your course project and the second half is a
tour of *the different schools of thought*. This is how I reconcile
my love of the Type Theory school's mathematics with my love of the
Critical Studies school's attention to humans.

** Paradigms
I left out one of the most common styles of PL courses. This arguably
represents its own school of thought, but I think that school is
fading in the research world.

When you look up a PL on Wikipedia, it often comes with a list of language paradigms, such as:
- Imperative
- Functional
- Logical
- Object-oriented

I'm not criticizing Wikipedia. These are meaningful technical terms that can be given meaningful definitions:

"Imperative:" The programmer's core mental abstraction is program state

"Functional:" The programmer's core mental abstraction is the input-output behavior of mathematical functions

"Logical:" The programmer's core mental abstraction is logical proof

"Object-oriented:" The programmer's core mental abstraction is objects

Lists of paradigms often include other terms like "scripting
language", "high level language", or "declarative language". These
terms do not have clear technical definitions, but they have
sociological significance - they mean something to the Lay
Practitioner school.

Why then don't I give you a tour of these paradigms?

Answer 1: I don't think you need a teacher for that.  I think
this is the kind of knowledge that people tend to self-study or study
from peers throughout their career.

Answer 2: Modern programming languages mix these paradigms
freely. As programmers, our abilities of self-expression have reached
the level where we don't need these boxes anymore.

Answer 3: I want to teach you lasting, generalizable knowledge, yet
help you connect that knowledge to stuff that happens in your real
life and career. The "Schools of Thought" approach gives you a broader
mental map of generalizable knowledge, and the project approach lets
you stay connected to your real life and career.


** The parts of a CS Theory project

On the project handout, "theory-heavy CS projects" align with the Type
Theory school. Let's take a tour of what a Type Theorist will say the
"parts" of a language are. We're taking this tour now because it's
also a guide to the first part of the course - if you design and build
a language, what are all the things you'll have to do?

Mini-outline:
- Syntax
- Execution (dynamic semantics)
- Types (static semantics)
- Correctness (soundness+verification)

**** Syntax (Is this a program? Which one?)
We will learn how to specify the syntax of a PL. We will use regular
expressions to describe the basic building blocks of a program and use
context-free grammars to describe how the pieces fit together. If you
took CS 3133 at WPI or similar courses, this section is likely review
for you. However, this section is important, because our students come
in all kinds.

**** Execution (How do I run it? What happens then?)
You will learn how a Type Theorist talks about running a program.
Operational semantics give an exact definition of this.  Even for
coding-heavy projects, it's great to outline the semantics first,
because it serves as a guide for your implementation.

PLs can be implemented with interpreters (another program, that runs
it) or compilers (a program that transforms it into another language,
which could be either high-level or low-level). You are welcome to do
either, but because another course covers compilers, I will focus on
interpreters, which are faster to implement but slower to run.


**** Types (static semantics)
Type Theorists care *a lot* about "What can I learn about your
program, without running it?" because this question is closely related
to "What can a PL designer do to put more correct code in the world?".

The first step is typically a type system. This is a set of
mathematical rules that assign types to programs and, importantly,
tell you if a program is well-typed (has a type) vs. ill-typed
(does not have a type at all). 

**** Correctness (Soundness+Verification)
The reason that catching well-typed and ill-typed programs is so
important: the Type Theorist spends a lot of time proving correctness
theorems such as Type Soundness: every well-typed program runs without
certain kinds of errors, and if it terminates, it gives back an answer
of the right type. Verification is an intimately-related school, but
includes "What can I learn about correctness after I write the code
and before I run it?".


** PL Thinking
After our mini-tour of the Type Theorist school, I can now tell you
what I meant when I said this course will teach you "PL Thinking,"
more properly called Type Theorist Thinking.

PL Thinking is the mindset that PL design is about
abstraction-building, PL discussion is abstraction-criticizing, and
programming is abstraction-using.

Exercise: Write some abstractions on board.

Examples:

Types:"I don’t care what x is, as long as it’s an integer"
Semantics:"I don’t care about compiler implementation details"
Correctness:"I don’t care what program you write, as long as it does X"

In C: divide program into procedures (like functions, but have state)
In Java: divide program into objects Objects combine state and code,
but hide some of it, making it abstract

In Racket: divide main function into helper functions In Racket/Lisp:
all language features are nested lists with parentheses.  This enables
*homoiconicity*, representing programs using the language's core
datatypes.

In this class, I don't care about being homoiconic.
I'm just here to be an iconic homo.

** Other projects

I love abstraction-building because it's a great mental workout and
lets us feel like mathematicians and artists at the same
time. However, there are important and severe limitations if this is
the only way we ever thinking. These limitations have been studied in
the humanities for decades in the contexts of philosophy and logic,
which are intimately connected to PLs.

The risk of abstraction-building is that it is reductionist. In the
humanities, this poses great dangers; we all know what happens when we
reduce a person to a narrow aspect of their identity and declare them
to be the Other, or when the people in power choose which aspects of
your identity you're allowed to care about and how.

Reductionist risks do transfer to PL world. PL-thinking courses have
been rightly criticized for emphasizing mathematical competition and
thus telling newcomers that they don't belong. They have also been
rightly criticized for de-emphasizing practice and application so much
that they end up significantly narrowing their audience.

** Conclusion: Not everything is a PL
My admittedly-ambitious dream is that my teaching approach can give
PL thinking its due credit for the beauty and programming power it
provides, while escaping the trap of reductionism and making this a
classroom for everyone. Let me know how I do.
